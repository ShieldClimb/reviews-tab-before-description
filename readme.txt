Move Reviews Tab Before Description for WooCommerce to boost trust, increase conversions, and get a Shopify-like product page.

== Description ==

Move Reviews Tab Before Description for WooCommerce is the ultimate solution for enhancing your product page layout. 

By default, WooCommerce places the Reviews tab after the Description tab, making it harder for customers to see social proof when browsing your products. 

This simple but powerful plugin helps you move the Reviews tab to a more prominent position, right before the Description tab.
